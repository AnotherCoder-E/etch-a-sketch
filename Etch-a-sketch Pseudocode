Etch-a-sketch Pseudocode

FIRST STEP - Create a 16x16 grid of square divs.
    
    Step 1. Start with a one square div. Adjust its size, border and properties,
then create more divs with Flexbox and Javascript.

	One way of creating 16 squares is to create a loop
that iterates 16 times and creates a square at each itera-
tion.

	Is there method in DOM for repetitive actions?
	
STEP FOUR - I need to create a feature that will create any grid
up to 100x100 grid.

	New grids should fit in the container for the 16x16 grid, so the
squares should have ability of shrinking or growing at demand.
Make a Git commit for actual version and work on a new feature.
